# README: Python Sets Study (EXP4)

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled3.ipynb`) documenting **Experiment 4: Study of Set in Python**. The experiment was conducted by **Arhan Nair** to explore the fundamental properties, operations, and practical applications of the `set` and `frozenset` data types in Python.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Set Properties

* **Unordered:** Sets do not maintain the order of elements.
* **Unique Elements:** Sets automatically handle and remove duplicate values upon creation or modification.
* **Mutability:** Standard sets allow adding and removing items.

### 2. Core Operations

The notebook demonstrates several built-in Python set operations:

* **Addition/Removal:** Using `.add()`, `.remove()`, and `.discard()`.
* **Union (`|`):** Combining all unique elements from two sets.
* **Intersection (`&`):** Identifying elements present in both sets.
* **Difference (`-`):** Identifying elements present in one set but not the other.
* **Symmetric Difference (`^`):** Identifying elements that are in either of the sets, but not both.

### 3. Specialized Types

* **Frozensets:** Demonstration of immutable sets that cannot be changed after creation.
* **Type Casting:** Converting a list with duplicates into a set to extract unique values.

## Practical Examples Included

The notebook applies set logic to real-world scenarios:

* **Course Management:** Removing and discarding courses from a curriculum.
* **Attendance Tracking:** Calculating absent students by finding the difference between a master list and the present list.
* **Common Interests:** Finding common subjects among multiple students using multi-set intersection.
* **Sports Analytics:** Categorizing students who play only cricket, only football, or both.

## How to Use

1. **Environment:** Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab, Jupyter Lab, or VS Code.
2. **Execution:** Run the cells sequentially to see the output of each set operation.
3. **Observation:** Note how the output order of sets may change between executions due to their unordered nature.
